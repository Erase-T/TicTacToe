# TicTacToe
Its an Android Mobile Application we created.
Like a game of tic-tac-toe we all know, this mobile game application has two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
